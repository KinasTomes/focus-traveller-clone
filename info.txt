Inheritance rights of individuals born from IVF techniques in Vietnam
In Vietnam, the law on in vitro fertilization (IVF) is mainly regulated in the 2013 Constitution, the 2015 Law on Marriage and Family, Decree 10/2015/ND-CP (amended by Decree 98/2016/ND-CP), along with inheritance regulations in the 2015 Civil Code.

Parenthood is a natural right
In the flow of history, people in all eras have basic needs, from survival to development, forming natural and objective human rights. Among them, the right to give birth and be a parent is one of the most important rights, closely linked to human values ​​and the nature of social life.

The Rise of IVF and the Legal Implications
Increasingly, children are being conceived using assisted reproductive technology, due to factors such as health, age or biology. This brings with it new legal issues, particularly regarding the inheritance rights of children born using this method.

The need to improve IVF legislation
This requires comprehensive and timely research to contribute to improving the legal system on giving birth using assisted reproductive technology in general. In particular, ensuring inheritance rights for individuals born using in vitro fertilization (IVF) is an important point that needs to be clearly and specifically regulated in current laws.

Lessons from international experience
Many countries have developed progressive legal frameworks to protect the rights of children born from IVF. These models are valuable references for Vietnam in perfecting the law in this new and sensitive field.
